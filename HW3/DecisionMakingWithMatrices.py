# Decision making with Matrices
# This is a pretty simple assingment.  You will do something you do everyday, but today it will be with matrix manipulations.
# The problem is: you and your work firends are trying to decide where to go for lunch. You have to pick a resturant thats best for everyone.  Then you should decided if you should split into two groups so eveyone is happier.
# Displicte the simplictiy of the process you will need to make decisions regarding how to process the data.
# This process was thoughly investigated in the operation research community.  This approah can prove helpful on any number of decsion making problems that are currently not leveraging machine learning.
