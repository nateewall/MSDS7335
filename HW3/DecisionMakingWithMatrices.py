# Decision making with Matrices

# This is a pretty simple assingment.  You will do something you do everyday, but today it will be with matrix manipulations.

# The problem is: you and your work firends are trying to decide where to go for lunch. You have to pick a resturant thats best for everyone.  Then you should decided if you should split into two groups so eveyone is happier.

# Displicte the simplictiy of the process you will need to make decisions regarding how to process the data.

# This process was thoughly investigated in the operation research community.  This approah can prove helpful on any number of decsion making problems that are currently not leveraging machine learning.



# You asked your 10 work friends to answer a survey. They gave you back the following dictionary object.

# the results of a survey about lunch preferences are captured in the following dictionary on a scale from 1 to 5 with each feature defined as:

# travelDistance: how far are they willing to travel
#       0: would rather stay in the building // 5: willing to drive 30+ minutes

# cost: how much are they willing to pay
#       0: a Cookout tray (NC thing) // 5: Michellin star tasting menu

# instagrammable: how important is the chance of a cool instagram pic
#       0: someone who has never had a social media account // 5:  Bon Appetit social media coordinator

# busy: a measure of a person's aversion to crowds or lines
#       0: a hermit // 5: Diddy in the club

# vegetarian: how important are vegetarian options
#       0: Ron Swanson // 5:'Vegan' tattooed on their chest

# institution: measure of this persons affinity to local institutions
#       0: millennial just looking for a juice bar // 5: atenured professor who get's greeted with a tea

# The most imporant idea in this project is the idea of a linear combination.

# Informally describe what a linear combination is and how it will relate to our restaurant matrix.


# Choose a person and compute(using a linear combination) the top restaurant for them.  What does each entry in the resulting vector represent.

# Next compute a new matrix (M_usr_x_rest  i.e. an user by restaurant) from all people.  What does the a_ij matrix represent?

# Sum all columns in M_usr_x_rest to get optimal restaurant for all users.  What do the entryâ€™s represent?

# Now convert each row in the M_usr_x_rest into a ranking for each user and call it M_usr_x_rest_rank.   Do the same as above to generate the optimal resturant choice.

# Why is there a difference between the two?  What problem arrives?  What does represent in the real world?

# How should you preprocess your data to remove this problem.

# Find user profiles that are problematic, explain why?

# Think of two metrics to compute the disatistifaction with the group.

# Should you split in two groups today?

# Ok. Now you just found out the boss is paying for the meal. How should you adjust. Now what is best restaurant?

# Tommorow you visit another team. You have the same restaurants and they told you their optimal ordering for restaurants.  Can you find their weight matrix?
